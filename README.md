- Large pizzas account for approximately 50% of sales, followed by medium pizzas at 31% and regular pizzas at 22%.

- During the rainy season in India, from July to October, overall sales decline because people prefer to stay indoors.

- The classic pizza category receives more orders and generates higher revenue, totaling 2.2 lakh and 11 thousand orders, respectively

- The number of people eating pizza on Thursdays has remained consistent over the years compared to other days.

- The Thai chicken pizza generates more revenue, it ranks third in terms of sales due to its higher price. On the other hand, the classic deluxe pizza generates less revenue but sells more because of its lower price.


## Conclusion
- To increase sales, we should reduce the prices of pizzas that have lower sales but higher prices.

- During the rainy season, home delivery of pizza may boost sales of the product.

- Purchase ingredients in advance during peak periods and reduce them during the rainy season.

- Offer coupons and bonuses during the rainy season to attract customers.
